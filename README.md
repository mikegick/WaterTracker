# WaterTracker
The water tracker project was created as a submission to the Nasa Space Apps challenge.  This project represents the mobile application portion of a much larger project that was developed to solve the Clean Water Mapping challenge.  The water tracker was developed leveraging the android studio, gradle build process, jackson RESTful library, and the google maps api.  The code base is written largely using java, and xml.

The mobile application will be used by technicians and other non technical staff to crowdsource location data about clean water sources.  The functionality that we developed for this application allows users to view all currently documented clean water locations within a 50 mile radius of their current or selected location via google maps.  We also provide functionality to users such that they are able to add new locations and provide a purpose  and category for that location.  The purpose can be drinking, agricultural, and *****.  The category can be government, spring, well, and lake.  We also provide the user with a sample id so that if the user is a technician that is taking water samples they can mark them with id's that can be used later on our website to add information about the clean water metrics.  As a user you can also view by filters such as purpose or category.  You may view only those that you have created.  You are also able to modify current data points and modify there purpose and category if they have changed over time.
